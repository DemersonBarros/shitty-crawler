# About

This project was just a way to introduce myself to unit test, practice more [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and use git more. Everything on this repository can be used freely. 

# How to make it run
 - run: 
```bash
$ npm install
```
 - Then the only thing that needs to be done is run:
```bash
$ npm start [URL0, ...URLn]
```

I'll not be maintaining this project, in the future proprably I'll make some changes but it isn't guaranteed.
